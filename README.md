Some basics of how to generate [accessible]() HTML pages from LaTeX sources, written as I learn how to do this myself.

- [Motivation](motivation.md) : Why do I care about accessible LaTeX
- [MathJax](mathjax.md) : Some detailed notes about MathJax.
- [make4ht](make4ht.md) : Some detailed notes about getting `make4ht` to convert LaTeX into HTML.
- [plasTeX](plastex.md) : A python module which, out the box, performs better than `make4ht`, but requires more knowledge to use.
- [BookDown](bookdown.md) : An entirely different solution, using RStudio to edit markdown, and compile to various outputs.  No working example yet.
- [LaTeX Notes](latex.md) : Some random notes about LaTeX usage
